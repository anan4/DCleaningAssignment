# Data Cleaning Assignment
## Coursuera's Data Cleaning course
### by anan4



This README file includes the instructions to execute the script stored in the run_analysis.R file also included in this github repo. This script provides the solution of the 5 exercises included in the assignment.

The script is divided in 6 parts. Initial and end of each part (code block) are clearly identified by the comments in the script:

0. Initial settings: Must be executed to run at the beginning. Can be adjusted to the particular settings of the developer
1. Exercise 1: Execute this script to get the results of this exercise.
2. Exercise 2: Execute this script to get the results of this exercise.
3. Exercise 3: Execute this script to get the results of this exercise.
4. Exercise 4: Execute this script to get the results of this exercise.
5. Exercise 5: Execute this script to get the results of this exercise.

## IMPORTANT: Scripts must be excuted in order, from 0 to 5, do not execute them randomly. You can also execute the whole script at once

The output of every exercise execution is:
1.  A data.table named "tidydata%" where % is the exercise number 
2.  A txt file named "tidy_data_set%.txt" where % is the exercise number

I hope you enjoy this script.
